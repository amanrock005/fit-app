                    In the 21st century, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are becoming commonplace. 
                    Both are becoming more important components of current workout routines. 
                    AI has become intrinsically connected to health and fitness. 
                    AI, according to technologists, improves everything. 
                    When it comes to fitness, it has the potential to empower the app by dramatically increasing engagement, which may lead to long-term income. 
                    The AI-enabled apps can give users a variety of advantages. It may save money for a fitness enthusiast, for example, because an artificial intelligence fitness trainer is less expensive than a human trainer, but joining a gym might be expensive or impossible to integrate into our busy life. 
                    In addition, AI-powered fitness software may make a workout more interesting and enjoyable. 
                    Here, we will mention top fitness apps which work on AI and machine learning models.
                    

                    We have trained the model in python because of tensorflowJS we can leverage the support of browser so I converted 
                    the keras/tensorflow model to tensorflowJS.
